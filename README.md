# ðŸš¨ Fraud Detection System with Machine Learning ðŸš¨

# ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

Fraudulent activities can damage trust and incur massive financial costs. This project builds a machine learning-based fraud detection system capable of accurately flagging suspicious transactions on the fly. Through detailed data analysis, feature engineering, model tuning, and evaluation, we have developed a model optimized for real-world deployment.

# Key Features

Real-Time Detection: Quickly classifies transactions as fraud or legitimate.

API-Ready: Deployable with FastAPI for seamless integration.

Precision and Recall Focus: Balanced to minimize both missed frauds and false alerts.

Scalable and Adaptable: Designed to handle growing transaction volumes and evolving fraud patterns.

# ðŸ“Š Project Steps

1. Data Exploration and Preparation
   
Explored transaction data to identify patterns.
Engineered features like transaction amount, time of day, location, and transaction type to improve fraud detection accuracy.
Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE, improving model sensitivity to rare fraudulent cases.
3. Model Training and Tuning

Models trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and cross-validation to optimize each modelâ€™s configuration.
Top Performer: Random Forest, selected based on F1-score and AUC-ROC.
4. Model Evaluation and Selection

Evaluated models with precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to select the best-performing model.
Visualized model performance with confusion matrices and comparison plots for easy understanding.
5. Deployment and API Setup

Saved the best model and set up a FastAPI endpoint.
API endpoint accepts transaction data, preprocesses it, and returns a fraud prediction and probability score.
Ready for integration in a production environment for real-time transaction monitoring.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started
